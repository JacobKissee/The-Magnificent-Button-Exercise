<h1>The Magnificent Button Exercise:<h1> 
<p>
	I know this is a very impressive first project. But remember, I'm merely mortal like the rest of you. Okay all jokes aside, I was sharpening my HTML and CSS skills by performing this button exercise. So, I wanted to share it with you guys. I welcome all feedback, 
  suggestions, and critiques. Thankyou for checking out my first repository. 
	Have a great day!
